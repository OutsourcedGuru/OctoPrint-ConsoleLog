# OctoPrint-ConsoleLog
Most websites today run using a variety of code. Often *on the browser itself* this code is in the JavaScript language. It's good when there are no JavaScript errors so that everything is running correctly. But sometimes that isn't the case.

This plugin should help to highlight when there are hidden JavaScript errors so that they may be dealt with. I would guess that this plugin would be most useful for OctoPrint plugin developers who need to keep an eye out for problems.

## How to open the developer's console

> **Developer's Console**: also known as "Web Development Tools", this is a hidden area of each browser which will show more information for a developer so that they may troubleshoot errors.

The rest of this document describes how to open this console, find the Console tab and to evaluate what errors could be there.

## Safari
Apple's default browser has a developer's console which may be toggled by pressing `Cmd`+`Option`+`c` at the same time.

It may be necessary to first turn on this feature with `Safari` -> `Preferences` -> `Advanced tab` -> `Show Develop menu in menu bar`.

## Internet Explorer and Edge
Both popular browsers by Microsoft have a developer's console which may be toggled by pressing the `F12` key.

## Chrome
Google's browser has a developer's console which may be toggled by pressing one of the following combinations based upon the operating system.

### On macOS
